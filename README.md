## Description

This program follows the work flow of the SBA example. IT allows users to log into their accounts,
Once signed in, they are shown a list of their enlisted classes. The user is then prompted to register 
to a new class. They are then shown a full list of all classes available in the database.
Once they make a selection, that selection is added to their course list and they are automatically logged out.


## Description

If you want to run this app on your local machine you can clone or download the zip file from github. Install Node and MySQL if you do not already have them. In the root directory, create a .env file with your mySQL credentials. Then in your terminal type 'npm install' and press enter. You are now all set to use the app!

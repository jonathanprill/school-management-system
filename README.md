## Description

This program follows the work flow of the SBA example. IT allows users to log into their accounts,
Once signed in, they are shown a list of their enlisted classes. The user is then prompted to register 
to a new class. They are then shown a full list of all classes available in the database.
Once they make a selection, that selection is added to their course list and they are automatically logged out.
